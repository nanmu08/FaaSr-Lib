#' @title Entry point to start execution of a FaaSr action
#' @description
#' This is the entry-point FaaSr Function that is invoked by a FaaS platform when an Action is instantiated
#' Terminology to clarify the various modules involved:
#'
#' * Action: an instance of a Docker container instantiated by a FaaS platform
#' * User Function: a single function written in R; at runtime, it is executed by a single Action
#' * FaaSr Function: function implemented by the FaaSr package to implement all the logic necessary to manage
#'     the execution of a User Function within an Action. A FaaSr function has a prefix faasr_
#' * User Workflow: a graph where each vertex represents a single User Functions and each edge represents a trigger
#' * Payload: a JSON-formatted text file that conforms to the FaaSr schema. It is delivered by the FaaS platform
#'     for each Action. It describes the entire User Workflow and may contain credentials for FaaS and S3 services
#'
#' faasr_start calls other FaaSr Functions to go through the following steps:
#'
#' * Parse the Payload and ensure that it conforms to the FaaSr JSON schema; otherwise, abort
#' * Build the User Workflow graph from Payload and ensure it is cycle-free; otherwise, abort
#' * Initialize the logs folder in an S3 bucket, only if this is the entry point to the User Workflow
#' * Ensure only a single User Function runs if it has multiple predecessors; otherwise, abort
#' * Invoke the User Function, supplying the parsed payload as a list argument
#' * Update the logs folder to assert that this User Function has completed
#' * Generate triggers to start Actions that will run the next User Functions, if there are any in the User Workflow
#' @param faasr_payload JSON Payload provided upon Action invocation by the FaaS platform

  # If parsing is successful, faasr is an R list storing the parsed JSON Payload
  # If parsing is not successful, the Action aborts with stop() before executing the User Function
  .faasr <<- faasr_parse(faasr_payload)

  # Build a data structure representing the User Workflow, from the parsed Payload
  # FaaSr only supports Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) User Workflows, with a single entry point

  # All logs, as well as any synchronization among actions, will be stored in the log folder
  # The log folder must be a unique name for each Action, such as a user-provided unique timestamp or UUID
  # If a log folder already exists, the Action aborts with stop() before executing the User Function
